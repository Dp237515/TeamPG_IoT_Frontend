    Do you ever wonder about the consequences of your words?
    Do you ever think about how I always take things in a light hearted manner?
    I want you to know that despite my nature and my tolerances, I am in fact a very sensitive and fragile person.
    I act as if I don't care and that it's funny, but it hurts. What's funny, in a morbid sense, is that each time
    it hurts less and less. It's not however, because I'm a strong person-- because I'm not. It's because I have
    numbed my emotions to avoid getting hurt. But that means all of my emotions. Sadness, anger, joy, envy-- everything.
    I am a shell of who I once was, and your words and everyone else's contributed to that. <br></br><br></br>
